// STREAM
// A stream is an event emitting object that lets us read or write data chunk by chunk instead of loading the whole data into memory at once
// it's useful for reading or writing large files

// Why would we use streams over other methods like fs.readFile?
// bcz fs.readFile() loads the entire file into memory which is inefficient for large files or even crash the app for very large files
// streams uses using less memory and faster

// data - A chunk of data is available
// end - end event fires after all the chunks are sent — it tells us the file is fully read
// error - Something went wrong
// close - The stream is closed

//fs.createReadStream?
//it's a method from the fs module that lets us read a file in chunks instead of loading the whole file into memory

//Syntax
const fs = require('fs')
//parameters- path,encoding,highWaterMark(size of each chunk in bytes)
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('filename.txt', { encoding: 'utf8', highWaterMark:16 });//read 16 bytes

readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log('Chunk:', chunk);  // logs parts of file
});

readStream.on('end',() => {
  console.log('Done reading file.')
});

readStream.on('error',(err) => {
  console.error('Error:', err)
})

//default chunk size is-- 64kb

//CreateWriteStream
//its a method used to write data to a file in chunks

// .write() - writes chunks(add chunks)
// .end() - closes the stream

//writeStream.write('Hello, ')
// writeStream.write('world!\n')
// writeStream.end('This is the end.')

//events of createwritestream:

//finish - All data has been written and the stream is closed
// error - An error occurred while writing
// close - The stream is closed (after finish or manual close)

const fs = require('fs');

const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writeStream.write('Hello World!\n');
writeStream.write('Writing some data...\n');
writeStream.end('Done!\n'); // triggers finish event

// Events
writeStream.on('finish', () => {
  console.log('Writing completed.');
});

writeStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.error('Error:', err);
});

writeStream.on('close', () => {
  console.log('Stream closed.');
});

//PIPE()
//the .pipe() method connects a readable stream to a writable stream so that data flows automatically from one to the other
//we don’t need to manually listen to data and write it 

const fs = require('fs');

const readStreamm = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writeStreamm = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readStreamm.pipe(writeStreamm);

//this reads input.txt chunk by chunk and writes it into output.txt

readStream.on('data', chunk => writeStream.write(chunk));
//.pipe() handles this automatically(bts)

//other than utf-8, we have--
// 'ascii'	Basic English characters only (0–127)
// 'hex'	Represents binary data as hexadecimal string
