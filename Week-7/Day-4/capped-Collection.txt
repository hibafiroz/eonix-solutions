Capped Collections:

- A capped collection is a fixed-size collection.
  It is basically used when we want to keep only the latest data. 

- We define a fixed size for the collection in bytes, and Once it reaches its size limit, MongoDB doesn't stop inserting data 
  instead it automatically removes the oldest documents to insert new ones.

- All this is handled internally by MongoDB, we don't manually delete anything
- It's mainly used for logs or streaming data where we only care about the most recent records.

Example:

db.createCollection("logs", {
  capped: true,
  size: 1024 * 1024,  // 1MB (given in bytes)
  max: 1000    //max documents we can insert (optional)
})
MongoDB is allowed to use ONLY 1MB for this collection

MongoDB does NOT stop inserts.
Instead New documents keep coming, Oldest documents disappear automatically


> Characteristics of Capped Collection:

1. Fixed size:
When we create a capped collection, we must give the size. We can’t change it later.

2. Must be explicitly created:
MongoDB will NOT auto-create capped collections, We must create explicitly.
We also can't convert a normal collection into capped easily. It must be created capped from the start.

3. Automatic overwrite of oldest documents:
Once size fills, MongoDB removes oldest docs automatically. We don’t delete manually.

4. Insertion order preserved:
Documents stay in the exact order they were inserted.

5. Very fast inserts:
Because:
Writes are sequential
No delete cleanup
MongoDB just overwrites
So inserts are faster than normal collections.

6. Document size is fixed after insertion:
After inserting a document, We cannot increase its size Because that would break the fixed-size structure.

7. Limited updates:
We can update fields only if size doesn’t grow.

8. No document deletion:
We cannot do deleteOne()
Only MongoDB itself can removes old docs and also We can't drop entire collection.

9. Limited index support:
We cannot use TTL index bcz the deletion happens in ttl, Text index bcz tokenization, inverted index structures, frequent updates
