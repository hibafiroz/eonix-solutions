Data Modeling & Storage Concepts:

1. Data Modeling:
Data modeling means designing:
> how data is stored in collections,
> how documents are structured and
> how relationships btw documents are managed.
whenevr we create a collection, the data folder creates two file, one for documents another for index(default one is ObjectId points to its doc location)


2. System Storage Basics:
MongoDB stores data on disk, but uses RAM for fast access.

a. RAM —> Random Access Memory.
> It is Temporary storage
> Stores data only while the computer is ON
> Data would be lost when the system shuts down
> But it is very fast So,
> CPU use this memory for Running programs and Caching recently accessed MongoDB data for fast reads.
> It has Small range of size : 8 GB, 16 GB, 32 GB

2 Disk:
> It is Permanent storage
> Data remains even after we shutdown the system
> But it is Slower than RAM
> It has Large capacity: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB, 2 TB
> It is classified into two types:
1. HDD > Hard Disk Drive - older, slower, uses magnetic plates
2. SSD > Solid State Drive - modern, fast, uses electronic memory blocks
Examples stored on disk: Photos, Videos, Apps, System files, MongoDB databases


3. How MongoDB Stores Data:
MongoDB stores data on disk in small, fixed-size units called pages/extents/blocks.
> Disk is divided into pages (small chunks of storage)
> MongoDB writes and reads the data inside these extents
> Documents are stored inside these pages


4. WiredTiger: MongoDB’s Default Storage Engine:
WiredTiger controls how MongoDB stores and manages data on disk.

Key Features of WiredTiger:
a. Data is stored in compressed form and Memory-mapped files allow fast access from RAM
b. Documents are organized using B-Trees and Makes search, insert, update operations fast
c. Only the document being modified gets locked and Allows high performance and concurrency
d. Provides consistent views of data for safe reads
e. Protects data against crashes and Ensures recovery after system failure


Document Embedding & Document References:

1. Document Embedding:
means storing related data directly inside the parent document using nested objects or arrays.
All related information stays together in one place.
It's fast bcz mongoDB can return everything in just one query, without looking up other collections.

When to Use Embedding:
a. If parent and child data are usually read in the same query.
b. If there are only a small number of related items.
c. Embedding is good as long as adding child data won't make the document grow too large as it has only 16MB document size limit.

2. Document References:
means storing only the reference(ID) of another document instead of embedding the entire child data.
The documents stay separate, but they remain connected through the reference.

it's useful bcz 
> It keeps documents smaller
> It is ideal when child data is large
> We can update child data independently
> And it Supports reuse of the same referenced data in many places.

When to Use References:
a. Many-to-Many Relationships: Both sides can grow large, so embedding is not possible.
b. Frequently Changing Data: Referenced data lives in its own document so updates touch only that document. This avoids rewriting the parent document.
c. If the child is not always read along with the parent, it deserves its own collection.
