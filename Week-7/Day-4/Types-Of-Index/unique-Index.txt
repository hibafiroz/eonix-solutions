6. Unique Index:

- A unique index is used to maintain data integrity and avoid duplicates like duplicate emails or usernames.
- If we try to insert a value that already exists, MongoDB rejects it and throws a duplicate key error.

- MongoDB also treats null as a value, so we cannot have multiple missing fields bcz they are treated as null by default.

Syntax
db.collection.createIndex(
  { fieldName: 1 },
  { unique: true }
)
Example
db.users.createIndex(
  { email: 1 },
  { unique: true }
)

If a document with an existing value is inserted:
{ email: "test@gmail.com" }
MongoDB Rejects the insert

> If two doc contain nothing in email field (null), It is considered as duplicate
{ email: null }
{ email: null }
NOT allowed with a unique index bcz MongoDB treats null as a value

> Field is missing (not present at all)
{ name: "A" }
{ name: "B" }
Also NOT allowed by default
Reason:
Missing fields are indexed as null
