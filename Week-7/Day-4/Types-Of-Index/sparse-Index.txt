7. Sparse Index:

- A sparse index means it only creates index entries for documents that actually have that field. 
  If some documents don’t contain that field, MongoDB just ignores them completely while indexing. 
  Bcz of that, the index becomes smaller.

- By default, even if a field is missing, MongoDB still indexes that document as null
- if we search for email: null, those missing-email documents won't come back bcz they were never indexed in the first place.

> Example:
[
  { name: "Hiba", age: 23 },
  { name: "Sara" },
  { name: "Ayaan", age: 25 }
]

db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 }, { sparse: true })

Only these get indexed:
{ name: "Hiba", age: 23 }
{ name: "Ayaan", age: 25 }

If we run:
db.users.find({ age: null })
Sparse index will not return documents without age bcz they are not indexed at all.
