1. Single Index:

A single-field index is an index created on one field of a document.
It is used when we perform operations using only single field.
So it reduces search time.


> If collection is:

db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "Hiba", age: 22 },
  { name: "Aisha", age: 25 },
  { name: "Sara", age: 20 }
])


> Creating a single-field index on age:
db.users.createIndex({ age: 1 })

> When should use single-field index?
Searching by a single field (find({ city: "Kochi" }))
Sorting by a field (sort({ age: 1 }))
Range queries (age > 20)
