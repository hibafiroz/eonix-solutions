MongoDB Text Search Operators:
MongoDB provides some operators for text search, and we use them inside $text.


1. $text:
$text operator is used to search text But before using $text, we must create a text index on string fields. 
If there is no text index, $text search will not work.

Syntax:
{ $text: { ... } }
$text is mandatory for all text search operations.



2. $search:
It specifies the actual text to search

Using $search, we can do single-word search that returns all documents containing that word, 
multiple-word search that returns documents that contain any of the searched words (uses OR logic), 
exact phrase search returns documents that contain exact searched words and 
we can also exclude words using a minus sign

By default, multiple words are treated as OR logic.

Examples:
$search: "developer"
$search: "backend developer"
$search: \"full stack developer\" : This matches "Looking for a full stack developer" NOT "Developer with full stack skills"
$search: "developer -junior"

Multiple Phrase Search (OR behavior):
$search: "\"final exam\" \"library rules\""
MongoDB search for documents that match EITHER of these phrases:
the exact phrase “final exam”
OR the exact phrase “library rules”



3. $language:
The $language option is used to specify the language for text search. It controls stemming rules, 
which means MongoDB converts words to their root form, like 'developers' to 'develop'. 
If we don't specify $language, MongoDB uses English by default.

Syntax : $language: "spanish"
Default language is english if not specified.

When we write : $language: "english"
MongoDB : uses English stemming rules and uses English stop words



4. $caseSensitive:
It controls whether text search is case-sensitive.
By default, it is false, so MongoDB treats uppercase and lowercase as the same.
When true, exact case matching is required.

Example:
$caseSensitive: true
Developer ≠ developer



5. $diacriticSensitive:
It decides if MongoDB should care about accent marks on letters.
Diacritic is a small symbols on letters
By default, it is false, so MongoDB ignores accent.
When true, accents must match exactly

Example:
café ≠ cafe   (when true)
Syntax : $diacriticSensitive:true

Combined Example:
db.collection.find({
  $text: {
    $search: "developer",
    $language: "english",
    $caseSensitive: false,
    $diacriticSensitive: false
  }
})
