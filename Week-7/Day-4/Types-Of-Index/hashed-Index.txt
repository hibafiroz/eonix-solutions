5. Hashed Index:

- A hashed index is used to change the field value into a hash number and stores that instead of the actual value. 
- When we search using query, MongoDB also hashes the search value and compares it. If it matches, MongoDB returns the corresponding document.

- Hashed index is mainly used for equality searches (searching for an exact value) and to spread data evenly. 
  It cannot be used for sorting or range search bcz hash values do not keep the original order.

Example:
"userId": "A001"

syntax: db.collection.createIndex({ fieldName: "hashed" })

db.users.createIndex({ userId: "hashed" })
"A001" → 2398472398472398.  This hash value is what gets stored in the index.

What Hashed Index is GOOD for?
Equality searches (field = value)
Uniform data distribution
Sharded collections

What Hashed Index is NOT good for?
Range queries (>, <, between)
Sorting
Prefix matching
ex: { userId: { $gt: "A001" } }
