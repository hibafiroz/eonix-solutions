9. TTL index: (Time To Live)

- TTL index is used to delete documents automatically after a certain time. 
- We create it on a Date field using expireAfterSeconds. 
- MongoDB runs a background process that checks expired documents and removes them. 
- It's mainly used for temporary data like OTPs.

- TTL index works in two ways. One way is based on expireAfterSeconds, where MongoDB deletes documents after a fixed time from a Date field.
- The second way is storing an exact expiry time inside the document and setting expireAfterSeconds to zero. 

- Used for auto-cleanup of old data.

Syntax:
db.sessions.createIndex(
  { createdAt: 1 },
  { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 }
)
Means Delete each document 1 hour after createdAt time.

> The Indexed field must be date type
{ createdAt: new Date() }
If it’s not Date, TTL will NOT work.

> How TTL Works Internally:
MongoDB runs a background job every ~60 seconds.

- Checks documents having TTL index
- Compares document date with current time
- If time ≥ expireAfterSeconds
- Deletes the document


> There are TWO ways TTL works:

1. TTL Based on Expiration Seconds:
We give MongoDB how many seconds to keep the document.

Example:
{
  message: "login failed",
  createdAt: new Date()
}

Create TTL index:
db.logs.createIndex(
  { createdAt: 1 },
  { expireAfterSeconds: 300 }
)

It says Keep this document for 5 minutes, then delete it.
MongoDB deletes each document 5 minutes after createdAt.

2. TTL Based on Exact Expiry Time:
Here, we directly store when the document should expire.

Example:
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Asha",
  expireAt: new Date("2025-01-01")
})

Create TTL index:
db.users.createIndex(
  { expireAt: 1 },
  { expireAfterSeconds: 0 }
)
When system time reaches that date → DELETE. No calculation.
MongoDB deletes document exactly when expireAt is reached.

- Its like ticket expiry: Valid till Jan 1, 2025, After that → invalid.

> Note:
- TTL index cannot be a compound index. It must be on a single Date field only.
db.users.createIndex(
  { createdAt: 1, status: 1 },
  { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 }
)
This will not work.

- TTL index does NOT work on String or Number fields.
{ createdAt: "2026-02-09" }   // string
{ createdAt: 1707450000 }    // number
MongoDB will ignore TTL on these.
