14. $count:

$count counts how many documents are currently passing through the pipeline
and returns ONE summary document.
Internally it works like $group with $sum: 1.

> syntax:
{ $count: "total" }
"total" becomes the field name in output.
{ total: 25 }


> Example:

db.users.aggregate([
 { $match: { status: "active" } },
 { $count: "totalUsers" }
])

output:
[
 { totalUsers: 10 }
]

$count is just a shortcut for:
{
 $group: {
   _id: null,
   total: { $sum: 1 }
 }
}

If ZERO documents reach $count:
it returns empty array, not { total: 0 }.
