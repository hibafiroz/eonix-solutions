1. $match:

- $match is basically used to filter documents in an aggregation pipeline. 
- It works similar to find(), but the difference is it’s used inside aggregation. 
- Whatever condition we give in $match, only those documents move to the next pipeline stage.

For example: 
[
 { name:"Hiba", age:22 },
 { name:"Sara", age:25 }
]

db.users.aggregate([
 { $match:{ age:22 } }
])                          // only name Hiba document is returned.

MongoDB automatically treats multiple conditions inside $match as AND.


> Note:

We cannot use comparision expr directly in match or find
$match: {
  city: 'Kochi',
  { $gt: ['$marks', 60] }
}

Can do in 2 ways:
1. db.aggregation.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      city: "Kochi",
      marks: { $gt: 60 }
    }
  }
])

2. db.aggregation.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      $expr: { $gt: ["$marks", 60] }
    }
  }
])
