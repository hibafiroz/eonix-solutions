1. $match:

- $match is basically used to filter documents in an aggregation pipeline. 
- It works similar to find(), but the difference is it’s used inside aggregation. 
- Whatever condition we give in $match, only those documents move to the next pipeline stage.

For example: 
[
 { name:"Hiba", age:22 },
 { name:"Sara", age:25 }
]

db.users.aggregate([
 { $match:{ age:22 } }
])                          // only name Hiba document is returned.
