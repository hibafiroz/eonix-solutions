2. $project:

- $project is used to control the structure of documents. 
- Basically, it lets us decide which fields we want to show, which ones to hide, and we can also rename fields or create new calculated fields. 
- It works exactly like projection in find(), but $project is more powerful because we can do transformations and calculations.

1 → include field
0 → exclude field

For example:
[
 {
  name:"Hiba",
  age:22,
  city:"Kannur",
  salary:20000,
  bonus:2000,
  password:"12345"
 }
]


> Include Fields.
db.users.aggregate([
 {
  $project:{
   name:1,
   city:1,
   _id:0
  }
 }
])                       //shows only name and city.


> Create new field.
{
 $project:{
  name:1,
  newName:"$city"
 }
}

> Rename field.
db.users.aggregate([
 {
  $project:{
   username:"$name",
   city:1,
   _id:0
  }
 }
])                           //name becomes username


> Arithmetic Operators inside $project:   starts with :["..."]
These are used to calculate values inside ONE document.

1. $add (Addition):
Adds two or more numbers.
for example:
{
 $project:{
  name:1,
  totalIncome:{ $add:["$salary","$bonus"] }
 }
}

2. $subtract (Subtraction):
{
 $project:{
  remaining:{ $subtract:["$salary",5000] }
 }
}

3. $multiply (Multiplication):
{
  $project: {
    total: { $multiply: ["$salary", 2] }
  }
}

4. $divide (Division):
{
 $project:{
  average:{ $divide:["$salary",2] }
 }
}
