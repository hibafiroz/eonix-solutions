6. $limit:

$limit is used to control how many documents are returned from the aggregation pipeline. 
It’s commonly used when we need only top records, latest entries, or during pagination to avoid fetching full data.

We use $limit when:
we want top 5 records
we want latest 3 items
we don’t want full data
for pagination

Get only top 2 students
db.students.aggregate([
 { $sort:{ marks:-1 } },
 { $limit:2 }
])
Only 2 documents returned.
